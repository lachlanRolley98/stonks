GIGA PARAMS:

buy_threshold (4 to 10)
This represents the score threshold needed to trigger a buy decision.
Higher values make it harder to trigger a buy (more conservative).
Lower values make the bot more aggressive, buying with weaker signals.

bb_threshold (1.5, 2, 2.5, 3)
This adjusts the sensitivity of the Bollinger Bands indicator.
Bollinger Bands measure volatility, with the upper/lower bands set by a number of standard deviations from the moving average.
Lower values (1.5) mean the bands are closer to the average, making it easier for prices to breach them (more signals).
Higher values (3) widen the bands, making breaches rarer (fewer signals).

macd_fast (5, 10, 12)
This defines the short-term EMA period for the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator.
A shorter period (5) reacts quickly to price changes, giving more frequent but possibly less reliable signals.
A longer period (12) smooths out the noise, giving fewer but stronger signals.

macd_slow (26, 50, 100)
This defines the long-term EMA period in MACD.
Smaller values (26) make the MACD more responsive to recent price changes.
Larger values (100) make it slower, focusing on longer-term trends.

rsi_period (14, 21)
This is the lookback period for the Relative Strength Index (RSI).
14 is the standard, offering a balanced view.
21 is slower, reducing false signals in volatile markets.

sma_short (5, 10, 15)
The short-term Simple Moving Average (SMA) period.
A smaller period (5) reacts faster to recent price changes, often used to capture short-term trends.
A larger period (15) smooths out noise, useful for more stable signals.

sma_long (50, 100, 200)
The long-term SMA period.
50 is common for medium-term trends, 100 for longer trends, and 200 is the classic indicator for long-term trend direction.
When the short SMA crosses above the long SMA, it's a bullish sign (and vice versa for bearish).
